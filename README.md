# Truck-sales-TSA
# Abstract
This project explores time series analysis of historical truck sales data to forecast future sales trends. The dataset spans several decades, capturing annual truck sales figures over time. Our objective is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates future truck sales based on historical trends. By analyzing past patterns, we aim to provide insights that support business decision-making, inventory management, and market strategy optimization.

# Introduction
The trucking industry plays a vital role in global logistics and commerce, facilitating the transportation of goods across vast distances. Understanding sales trends in the truck market is crucial for manufacturers, dealers, and policymakers to make informed decisions. Various factors, including economic conditions, fuel prices, and industry regulations, can influence truck sales patterns.

This study focuses on analyzing long-term trends in truck sales data using time series analysis. By examining historical sales figures, we aim to identify trends, potential seasonality, and external factors affecting demand fluctuations. The ultimate goal is to develop a forecasting model that can provide accurate sales predictions. Through this analysis, we seek to contribute to market insights that can enhance sales strategies, production planning, and overall business efficiency


# Conclusion
In this project, we developed a SARIMA(3,1,0)(1,1,2,12) model to forecast truck sales. The model effectively captured both seasonality and trend, aligning closely with actual sales data. The forecasted values followed the same pattern as the observed data, demonstrating the modelâ€™s ability to generalize well.
Overall, this model provides a strong predictive framework for truck sales, making it valuable for demand forecasting and strategic decision-making in the industry. ðŸš›
